Yes, Django signals by default run in the same thread as the caller.

Let's check a simple example to calm down our minds. We will use Django signals, a signal handler, and the threading library to check the thread in which both the signal and the signal handler are executed.

Steps:
We will produce a signal.
Connect the signal to a signal handler.
We will print the name of the current thread in both the caller and the handler, so we can check if they are equal.
